# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ForenCrack Droid is a digital forensics tool designed for government-authorized forensic investigators and departments. The system provides lawful access capabilities for analyzing and unlocking Android devices through multiple attack vectors, supporting both USB debugging enabled and disabled scenarios. The tool ensures forensic compliance with comprehensive evidence logging and chain-of-custody documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want to detect and analyze Android devices with USB debugging enabled, so that I can perform authorized forensic analysis using ADB commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Android device with USB debugging is connected THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the device via ADB
2. WHEN a device is detected THEN the system SHALL identify the lock type (PIN, Pattern, Password)
3. WHEN analyzing the device THEN the system SHALL detect screen timeout and lockout configurations
4. IF the device is rooted THEN the system SHALL attempt to pull gesture.key or password.key files
5. WHEN device metadata is available THEN the system SHALL collect IMEI, serial number, brand, and model information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want to perform brute-force attacks on screen locks for USB debugging enabled devices, so that I can gain lawful access to locked Android devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing brute-force attacks THEN the system SHALL use simulated input via adb shell input commands
2. WHEN cracking passwords THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU-accelerated cracking with Hashcat
3. WHEN encountering lockout delays THEN the system SHALL automatically handle delays and continue attempts
4. WHEN using dictionary attacks THEN the system SHALL support custom wordlists and common PIN/pattern databases
5. WHEN performing attacks THEN the system SHALL use multithreaded processing for optimal performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want to analyze Android devices with USB debugging disabled, so that I can perform forensic analysis on secured devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN USB debugging is disabled THEN the system SHALL attempt Emergency Download Mode (EDL) access
2. WHEN in EDL mode THEN the system SHALL support flashing recovery or dumping NAND via Firehose loaders
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN the system SHALL use OpenCV for image-based pattern recognition and cracking
4. WHEN standard methods fail THEN the system SHALL support cold boot and side-channel attack simulations
5. WHEN accessing device storage THEN the system SHALL handle NAND dumps and partition analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want comprehensive evidence logging and reporting, so that I can maintain chain-of-custody and generate court-admissible documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing any forensic operation THEN the system SHALL log every attempt with precise timestamps
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create both JSON and PDF format outputs
3. WHEN collecting evidence THEN the system SHALL maintain chain-of-custody logging with SHA-256 hash verification
4. WHEN starting analysis THEN the system SHALL require formal case ID input for authorization
5. WHEN storing logs THEN the system SHALL preserve integrity with cryptographic hashes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want role-based access controls and legal compliance features, so that I can ensure authorized use and legal compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system THEN users SHALL be authenticated with role-based permissions
2. WHEN starting any operation THEN the system SHALL display legal disclaimer and require consent
3. WHEN recovering user data THEN the system SHALL immediately encrypt all recovered information
4. WHEN operating THEN the system SHALL only function within authorized forensic lab environments
5. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails for all user actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a forensic investigator, I want optimized performance features, so that I can efficiently process multiple devices and complex attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing attacks THEN the system SHALL use dictionary + mask hybrid attack strategies
2. WHEN prioritizing attempts THEN the system SHALL use heuristic prioritization for common PINs and patterns
3. WHEN processing multiple devices THEN the system SHALL support multithreaded cracking queue systems
4. WHEN encountering delays THEN the system SHALL automatically manage lockouts and timing restrictions
5. WHEN utilizing hardware THEN the system SHALL leverage GPU acceleration for password cracking operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper installation and configuration management, so that I can deploy the toolkit in authorized forensic environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL support Kali Linux and Ubuntu Forensic Edition platforms
2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL integrate with ADB, Fastboot, EDL.py, and OpenCV tools
3. WHEN setting up THEN the system SHALL provide PyQT5 or Electron.js GUI interface options
4. WHEN initializing THEN the system SHALL load custom wordlists and Android patterns databases
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include Hashcat and John the Ripper integration
