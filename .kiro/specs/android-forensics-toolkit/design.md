# Design Document

## Overview

ForenCrack Droid is architected as a modular Python-based forensics toolkit with a layered design that separates device communication, attack engines, evidence management, and user interface concerns. The system supports multiple attack vectors through pluggable modules while maintaining strict evidence integrity and legal compliance throughout all operations.

## Data Models

### Device Profile
```python
@dataclass
class AndroidDevice:
    serial: str
    model: str
    brand: str
    android_version: str
    imei: Optional[str]
    usb_debugging: bool
    root_status: bool
    lock_type: LockType
    screen_timeout: int
    lockout_policy: LockoutPolicy
```

### Attack Strategy
```python
@dataclass
class AttackStrategy:
    strategy_type: AttackType
    target_device: AndroidDevice
    wordlists: List[str]
    mask_patterns: List[str]
    max_attempts: int
    delay_handling: DelayStrategy
    gpu_acceleration: bool
```

### Evidence Record
```python
@dataclass
class EvidenceRecord:
    case_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    operation_type: str
    device_serial: str
    attempt_number: int
    result: str

- **Report Generation Errors:** Partial report recovery mechanisms

### System-Level Error Handling
```python
class ForensicsException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: str, evidence_impact: bool):
        self.message = message
        self.error_code = error_code
        self.evidence_impact = evidence_impact
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        
    def log_error(self):
        # Log to evidence system with integrity preservation
        pass
```

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing
- **Access Control Validation:** Role-based permission enforcement
- **Evidence Tampering Detection:** Integrity verification under attack
- **Encryption Strength:** Cryptographic implementation validation
- **Audit Trail Completeness:** Chain of custody gap detection

### Performance Testing
- **GPU Acceleration Benchmarks:** Hashcat performance optimization
- **Multi-threading Efficiency:** Concurrent attack coordination
- **Memory Usage Profiling:** Large wordlist and device handling
- **Network Communication Latency:** EDL and ADB response times

### Compliance Testing
- **Legal Requirement Validation:** Disclaimer and consent workflows
- **Evidence Standards Compliance:** Court-admissible report formats
- **Chain of Custody Integrity:** Forensic standard adherence
- **Access Control Auditing:** Role-based security validation

### Test Environment Setup
```python
class ForensicsTestEnvironment:
    def setup_test_devices(self):
        # Configure Android emulators with known lock screens
        pass
        
    def create_mock_evidence(self):
        # Generate test evidence with known hashes
        pass
        
    def validate_legal_compliance(self):
        # Verify disclaimer and consent mechanisms
        pass
```

The design emphasizes modularity, evidence integrity, and legal compliance while providing the technical capabilities needed for authorized Android device forensics. Each component is designed to be testable, maintainable, and extensible for future enhancements.
